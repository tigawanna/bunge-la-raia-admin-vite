They favor a progressive tax system,  are willing to invest in job creation even at the cost of pension funds, and believe in providing state land for agriculture to address unemployment and food security. This candidate also champions inclusivity, envisioning a government with a strong youth presence and advocating for the use of public services by all public servants. \n\nWhile their focus on youth and social welfare is admirable, the candidate's economic plan hinges on potentially unrealistic and unsustainable solutions. The reliance on agriculture, venom farming, hyena skins, and organ leasing raises concerns about feasibility and ethical implications. The candidate's willingness to sacrifice personal body parts for a hostage situation, while demonstrating a sense of sacrifice, also raises questions about their judgment and ability to make rational decisions under pressure. \n\n**Strong Points:**\n\n* **Progressive Taxation:**  Advocates for a progressive tax system that protects the lower earners, demonstrating an understanding of income inequality and a commitment to social justice.\n* **Youth-Focused:**  Prioritizes youth employment and representation in government, acknowledging the demographic realities and potential of the young population.\n* **Inclusive Government:**  Strives for a government that reflects the diversity of Kenyan society, particularly emphasizing the role of youth.\n* **Social Welfare:**  Demonstrates a commitment to improving the lives of ordinary citizens through policies aimed at reducing unemployment, ensuring food security, and promoting inclusivity.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n* **Unrealistic Economic Solutions:**  The reliance on unconventional and potentially unsustainable revenue sources like venom farming, hyena skins, and organ leasing raises concerns about their economic understanding and feasibility.\n* **Lack of Detail:**  The candidate's proposed solutions lack concrete details and practical implementation plans, raising questions about their ability to translate vision into action.\n* **Judgment and Decision-Making:**  The candidate's willingness to sacrifice personal body parts in a hostage situation raises concerns about their ability to make rational and measured decisions under pressure.\n* **Potential for Corruption:**  The candidate's potential vulnerability to embezzlement scandals raises concerns about their integrity and ability to manage public funds responsibly. \n"},
